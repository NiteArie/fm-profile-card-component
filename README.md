# Profile Card Component

## General

Challenge is to build out this profile card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. I will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that I'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train my eyes to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.
